### HiðŸ‘‹
-  I'm a junior developer doing my best to enter the mobile app market by studying and making projects.
-  I'm also starting college this year to have a wider knowledge about programming.
-  The projects that best sum up my current level on React-Native are **tikfollows** and **ytmusicclone**.
